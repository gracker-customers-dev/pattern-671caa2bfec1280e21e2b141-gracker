                        <p>A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and regulates network traffic based on established security protocols. It helps to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network, making it an essential tool for protecting sensitive information shared through email marketing.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Types of Firewalls</h3>

                        <p>Hardware firewalls are physical devices placed between a network and its gateway. They serve as a frontline defense against external threats and can manage multiple devices at once. Businesses often use hardware firewalls for robust network security.</p>

                            
                        <h4>Software Firewalls</h4>

                        <h4>Next-Generation Firewalls</h4>

                            
                        <p>Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) combine traditional firewall features with advanced capabilities such as intrusion prevention, application awareness, and deep packet inspection. They are designed to protect against sophisticated threats and are essential for modern network security.</p>
